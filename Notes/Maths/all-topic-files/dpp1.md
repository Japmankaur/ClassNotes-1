- $f(x) = 2x^3 + x^2 + 3x - 8, \ a = 1$

- $f(x) = 2^x, \ a = 1$

#### Theory and Examples
- Use the Taylor series generated by $e^x$ at $x = a$ to show that 
$e^x = e^a \left[ 1 + (x - a) + \frac{(x - a)^2}{2!} + \ldots \right]$

- Find the Taylor series generated by $e^x$ at $x = 1$. Compare your answer with the formula in Exercise 29.

- Let $f(x)$ have derivatives through order $n$ at $x = a$. Show that the Taylor polynomial of order $n$ and its first $n$ derivatives have the same values that $f$and its first $n$ derivatives have at $x = a$.


- Of all polynomials of degree â‰¤ n, the Taylor polynomial of order n gives the best approximation. Suppose that $f(x)$ is differentiable on an interval centered at $x = a$ and that $g(x) = b_0 + b_1(x-a) + \cdots + b_n(x-a)^n$ is a polynomial of degree n with constant coefficients $b_0, \cdots, b_n$. Let $E(x) = f(x) - g(x)$. Show that if we impose on $g$ the conditions

a) $E(a) = 0$     The approximation error is zero at $x = a$.

b) $\lim_{{x \to a}} \frac{E(x)}{(x-a)^n} = 0$  The error is negligible when compared to $(x-a)^n$.

then
$$ g(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2 + \cdots + \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n. $$

Thus, the Taylor polynomial $P_n(x)$ is the only polynomial of degree less than or equal to n whose error is both zero at $x = a$ and negligible when compared with $(x-a)^n$.

## Quadratic Approximations

The Taylor polynomial of order 2 generated by a twice-differentiable function $f(x)$ at $x = a$ is called the quadratic approximation of $f$ at $x = a$. In Exercises 33-38, find the (a) linearization (Taylor polynomial of order 1) and (b) quadratic approximation of $f$ at $x = 0$.

- $f(x) = \ln(\cos x)$ 

- $f(x) = e^{x^2}$

- $f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}$

- $f(x) = \cosh x$

- $f(x) = \sin x$

- $f(x) = \tan x$
