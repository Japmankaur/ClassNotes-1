## Current

Current is the flow of charge per unit time. 

$I = q/t$

Unit: CT^-1 or Ampere

## Resistance 

Resistance is the opposition that a substance offers to the flow of electric current. 

Factors on which Resistance depends: 

* R \propto length
* R \propto 1/Area of Cross Section
* R \propto Nature of Material

$R = œÅ l/A$

## Ohm's Law

Ohm's Law may be defined as physical state i.e., Temperature, Pressure remaining same, Current flowing through conductor is directly proportional to Potential Difference applied across its ends.

$V = IR$

Limitations: 

1. It can't be applied to circuits consisting of electronic tubes, transistors, diodes because such elements are not bilateral elements.
2. It can't be applied to circuits consisting of non linear elements such as powdered carbon, thyrite and electric arc.

## Work

Work is said to be done on a body when a force acts on it and the body moves through some distance. 

$W = F.s$   (F = Force, s = distance)

SI Unit: Joule

Work done is stored in body in form of energy. Therefore, SI Unit of Energy is as same as Work done. 

## Potential Energy

Energy stored in body due to virtue of its position. 

$PE = mgh$

## Kinetic Energy

Energy possessed by a body by virtue of its motion. 

$KE = 1/2 mv^2$

## Electrical Energy

A Charge Q Coulomb moves a potential difference V in time t, then 

$Electrical Energy = QV 
                    = I^2RT
                    = VIT 
                    = V^2T/R$

1 Joule is also known as Watt-Second. 

## Thermal Energy

1 Calorie is the amount of heat required to riase the temperature of 1 gram of water through 1 degree celsius. 

## Power

Power is the rate at which work is being done or the rate at which enery is expanded. 

$Power = Work / Time$

Unit: Joule/sec or Watt

$Power = VI = I^2R = V^2/R$

## Joule's Law of Heating

$Heat = I^2 RT$







## Important Conversions

* 1 KWh = 36 X 10^5 Joule
* 1 Coulomb = 624 X 10^26 electron
* 1 Calorie = 4.186 Joule
* 1 Wh = 860 Calorie
* 1 hp = 746 Watt

Note: 1 Board of Trade Unit means 1 KWh
