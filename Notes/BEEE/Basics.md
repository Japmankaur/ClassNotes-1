## Current

Current is the flow of charge per unit time. 

$I = \frac{q}{t}$

Unit: CT^-1 or Ampere

## Resistance 

Resistance is the opposition that a substance offers to the flow of electric current. 

Factors on which Resistance depends: 

* $R \propto length$
* $R \propto \frac{1}{Area of Cross Section}$

$R = œÅ \frac{l}{A}$

## Effect of temperature on resistace

**Pure metals**- When the Resistance is made of some pure metal its resistance increases with increase in temperature the increase is large and fairly uniform therefore temperature- resistance graph is a straight line thus pure metals have positive temperature coefficient resistance

**Alloys**- When the resistance is made of some alloy its resistance increases with increase in temperature .But this increase is very small but irrregular so increase in resistance is almost negligible over a considerable range of temperature 

**Semiconductors,insulators and electolytes**-The resistance of semiconductors, insulators and electrolytes decreases with increase in temperature .The decrease is non uniform thus these materials have negative  temperature coefficient .

## Ohm's Law

Ohm's Law may be defined as physical state i.e., Temperature, Pressure remaining same, Current flowing through conductor is directly proportional to Potential Difference applied across its ends.

$V = IR$

Limitations: 

1. It can't be applied to circuits consisting of electronic tubes, transistors, diodes because such elements are not bilateral elements.
2. It can't be applied to circuits consisting of non linear elements such as powdered carbon, thyrite and electric arc.

## Work

Work is said to be done on a body when a force acts on it and the body moves through some distance. 

$W = F \cdot s$   (F = Force, s = distance)

SI Unit: Joule

Work done is stored in body in form of energy. Therefore, SI Unit of Energy is as same as Work done. 

## Potential Energy

Energy stored in body due to virtue of its position. 

$PE = mgh$

## Kinetic Energy

Energy possessed by a body by virtue of its motion. 

$KE = \frac{1}{2} mv^2$

## Electrical Energy

A Charge Q Coulomb moves a potential difference V in time t, then 

$Electrical Energy = QV 
                    = I^2RT
                    = VIT 
                    = \frac{V^2T}{R}$

1 Joule is also known as Watt-Second. 

## Thermal Energy

1 Calorie is the amount of heat required to riase the temperature of 1 gram of water through 1 degree celsius. 

## Power

Power is the rate at which work is being done or the rate at which enery is expanded. 

$Power = \frac{Work}{Time}$

Unit: Joule/sec or Watt

$Power = VI = I^2R = \frac{V^2}{R}$

## Joule's Law of Heating

$Heat = I^2RT$

## Circuit Wlements and Connected Terminology

#D1

**Electrical Circuit** is an interconnection physical, electrical devices such as energy source, energy converter and conductors that connect them.

**Energy Source** An energy source such as primary or secondary cell, a generator is a device that converts chemical, mechanical, thermal or some other form of energy to electrical energy.

**Energy Converter** also called load converts electrical energy into light, heat and mechanical work and so on 

#D2 


**Open Source Voltage**: The source emf or open circuit voltage, the voltage that appears across the source when no load is connected to it. When a load is connected to the source terminals and the circuit is closed and electric current starts flowing through circuit. Now voltage across source terminal is called as terminal voltage is not equal to source emf it is due to voltage drop inside source

## Linear and Non-Linear Circuits

**Linear Circuits:** Resistive elements for which the volt-ampere characterstics is a straight line are called linear resistive elementa and the electrical circuits containing only linear resistance are called linear circuits.

**Non-Linear Circuits:** Resistive elements for which the volt-ampere characterstics other than straight lines and electrical circuits containing them are non linear circuits eg- Resistance, Conductor and Capacitor. 

## Unilateral and Bilateral Circuits

**Unilateral Circuits**- An electrical circuit whose characterstics change with the direction of operation is called unilateral circuits. 

**Bilateral Circuits**- An electrical circuit whose characterstics are same in either direction is called bilateral circuits. eg- Transmission line.

## Active and Passive Network

**Active Network**-An electrical network which contains one or more than one source of emf.

**Passive Network**- A network which does not contain any souurce any source of emf.

## Active and Passive Elements

**Active Element**- The element which supplies energy to circuit.

E1 and E2 are active elements 

#D3


**Passive Elements:** The elements which recieve energy are called passive elemenents 

## Basic Terms

Node: Node is a point where two or more ements are joined.
Node- A,B,C,D

Junction: is a point where 3 or more points are joined.
Ex: B,D

Branch: It is the part of network which lies between two junction. 
Ex: BAD,BCD,BD
