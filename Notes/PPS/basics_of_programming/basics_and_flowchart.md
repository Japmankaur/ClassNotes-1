# Basics of programming

# Programming
- It is a set or collection of instruction that perform specific task when executed by a computer.

# Programming Language :-
- It is a formal computer Kanguage designed to communicate instructions to a machine (computer).

# Algorithm:-
- A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem solving operation by a Computer

# Steps in Problem Solving
- First produce a general algorithm.
- Refine the algorithm to get step by step detailed algorithm

# Flow Chart
- A general representation of sequence ofM operation in a program.
- It is a picture / graphical representation of problem solving process.
- It gives a step by step procedure for solution of a problem.
# Elements of a flow Chart
## Geometrical proces boxes:-
- It describes steps of solution.
## Arrows:-
- It describes flow of solution.
# Geometrical boxes :-
## Terminal :-
- Oval Shape
-  Stop/Start
## Input/Output :-
- Parallelogram
- It describes Input/output.
## Process box :-
- Rectangle
- It describes processing to be performed.
## Decision box :-
- Diamond
- It describes/decide which path to be followed
## Connector box :-
- Circle
- To connect different  paths of flow charts
## Arrows :-
- It describes flow of Execution
# Types of flow Chart :-
- Horizontal
- Vertical
- Panoramic
- Architectural

# Examples of Flow Chart

  C-->D[Compute average sum/3]
  D-->E[/Print average value /]
  E-->F([Stop])
```

# Example of algorithm

## Design an algorithm to add two No's
- Step 1 :- Start
- Step 2 :- Declare 3 integers a,b,c
- Step 3 :- Define values of a and b
- Step4 :- Add values of a and b
- Step 5:- Store output of step 4 to c
- Step 6:- print c
- Step7:- Stop
# Pseudocode:-
- Artifical / Informal language used to develope algorithm.
- It is similar to everyday english.
