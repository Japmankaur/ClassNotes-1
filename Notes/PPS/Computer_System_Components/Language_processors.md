# Low Level Language

## Definition:-

- In computer science, a low-level programming language isa programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architecture-commands or functions in the language map closely to processor instructions. Generally this refers to either machine code or assembly language.
- Low-level language is a programming language that deals with a computer's hardware components and constraints. 
- Low-level language may also be referred to as a computer's native language. 
- Machine language and assembly language are popularexamples of low level languages.

#  High Level Language
  
## Definition:

- A high-level language is a programming language such as C, FORTRAN, or Pascal that enables a programmer to write programs that are more or less independent of a particular type of computer.
- Such languages are considered high-level because they are closer to human languages and further from machine languages.
- High-level language is any programming language that enables development of a program in much simpler programming

#  Assembly Language
  
## Definition:
  
- A low level language that is similar to machine language.
- Uses symbolic operation code to represent the machine operation code.

# Language Processor Or language Translator

## Definition:
- A translator is a computer program that performs the translation of a program written. in a given programming language into a functionally equivalent program in a different computer language, without losing the functional or logical structure of the original code (the "essence" of each program) Programming language processor (assembler, compiler, or interpreter) that converts a computer program written in one language to another language.
  
## Types of Language Processors

The language processors can be any of the following three types:
1. Compiler
2. Interpreter
3. Assembler
   
##  Compiler
- A compiler is a computer program that transforms source code written in programming language into another computer language. Typically from high level to low level source code. In a compiler, the source code is translated to object code successfully if it is free of errors. The compiler specifies the errors at the end of the compilation with line numbers when there are any errors in the source code. The errors must be removed before the compiler can successfully recompile the source code again the object program can be executed number of times without translating it again.
-  For example C

## Interpreter
- The translation of a single statement of the source program into machine code is done by a language processor and executes immediately before moving on to the next line is called an interpreter. If there is an error in the statement, the interpreter terminates its translating process at that statement and displays an error message. The interpreter moves on to the next line for execution only after the removal of the error.An interpreter translates one line at a time and then executes it.
- Example: Perl, Python and Matlab.

##  Assembler
- The Assembler is used to translate the program written in Assembly language into machine code.  Assembly language is some sort of instructions like ADD, MUL, MUX and so on, and the assembler is basically able to convert these in binary code.
- For example, the architecture of intel 8085 and intel 8086 are different.

# Linker
- A linker is special program that combines the object files, generated by compiler/assembler and other pieces of code to originate an executable file has .exe extension. In the object file, linker searches and append all libraries needed for execution of file. It regulates the memory space that will hold the code from each module. It also merges two or more separate object programs and establishes link among them.

#   Loader
- It is special program that takes input of executable files from linker, loads it to main memory, and prepares this code for execution by computer.
- Loader allocates memory space to program. It is in charge of loading programs and libraries in operating system. The embedded computer systems don't have
loaders. In them, code is executed through ROM.

# Difference between COMPILER and Interpreter


# Compiler vs Interpreter

| Characteristics | Compiler | Interpreter |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Code Conversion | Converts entire source code to machine code | Translates source code line by line |
| Analysis Time | Longer analysis time | Shorter analysis time |
| Execution Time | Faster execution time | Slower execution time |
| Error Handling | Error messages after scanning entire program | Error messages during translation |
| Debugging | Harder debugging | Easier debugging |
| Memory Requirements | More memory required | Less memory required |
| Intermediate Code | Generates object code | No intermediate code |
| Security | More secure | Less secure |
| Examples | C, C++, C# | Python, Perl, JavaScript |

## Key Differences

### Compiler

* Converts entire source code to machine code before execution
* Longer analysis time, faster execution time
* Harder debugging, more memory required
* Generates object code, more secure

### Interpreter

* Translates source code line by line during execution
* Shorter analysis time, slower execution time
* Easier debugging, less memory required
* No intermediate code, less secure

# Difference between LINKER and LOADER 


# Linker vs Loader

| **Characteristics** | **Linker** | **Loader** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Main Function** | Generate executable files | Load executable files to main memory |
| **Input** | Object code generated by compiler/assembler | Executable files generated by linker |
| **Process** | Combine various pieces of code and source code to obtain executable code | Load executable codes to main memory for further execution |
| **Types** | Linkage Editor, Dynamic Linker | Absolute, Relocating, Direct Linking, Bootstrap |
| **Additional Responsibilities** | Combine object modules, allocate addresses, arrange objects in address space | Adjust references used within the program |
| **Definition** | Process of combining code and source code to obtain executable code | Process of loading executable codes to main memory for further execution |
