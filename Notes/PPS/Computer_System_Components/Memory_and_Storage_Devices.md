# Memory and storage devices of Computer System

## Computer System

A Computer is an electronic device that stores, manipulates and retrieves the data. We can also refer computer computes the information supplied to it and generates data.

A System is a group of several objects with a process. For Example: Educational System involves teacher, students (objects). Teacher teaches subject to students i.e. teaching (process).

Similarly a computer system can have objects and process. The following are the objects of computer System 
1. User ( A person who uses the computer)
2. Hardware
3. Software

## Hardware

Hardware of a computer system can be referred as anything which we can touch and feel. Example Keyboard and Mouse.

The hardware of a computer system can be classified as
1. Input Devices(I/P)
2. Processing Devices (CPU)
3. Output Devices(O/P)

## Arithmetic and logical unit (ALU)

It performs the Arithmetic and Logical Operations such as 
1. +,-,*,/ (Arithmetic Operators)
2. &&, || ( Logical Operators)

## Control unit (CU)

Every Operation such as storing , computing and retrieving the data should be governed by the control unit. OUTPUT ALU, CU, MONITOR MEMORY UNIT (MU), KEYBOARD

## Memory unit (MU)

Memory is a storage part in a computer system. It is used to store the data, information and programs at the time of processing on the computer. It stores data either temporarily or permanent. The main use of memory is saving and
retrieving data.

The Memory unit is used for storing the data. The Memory unit is classified
into two types. They are
1) Primary Memory
2) Secondary Memory

## Primary memory

It is called the internal memory of the computer. And it is also known as main memory or Temporary memory. It holds the data and instructions that are presently working on the system or by the CPU. Primary Memory is called volatile memory, because when power is switched off it loses all data.

Primary memory is generally of two types.

1. **RAM** - It stands for Random Access Memory. RAM is a read /writes memory. It is referred as main memory of the computer system. It is a temporary memory. The information stored in RAM is lost whenever the power supply to the computer is switched off.

RAM is of two types which are as follows -

- *Static RAM* − Static RAM also known as SRAM. In this RAM the information is stored as long as the power supply is ON. SRAM are of higher coast and consume more power .They have higher speed than Dynamic RAM
     
- *Dynamic RAM* − Dynamic RAM also known as DRAM, This type of RAM stores information in a very short time basically, a few milliseconds even though the power supply is ON. The Dynamic RAM is cheaper and of moderate speed and also they consume less power.

   
2. **ROM** - It stands for Read Only Memory. ROM is a permanent type of memory. ROM information is not lost when power supply is switched off. The Content of ROM is inserted by the computer manufacturer and permanently stored at the time of manufacturing. ROM cannot be overwritten by the computer. It is also called Non- Volatile Memory.

ROM is of three types which are as follows -

- *PROM (Programmable Read Only Memory)* − It is used to write data once and read many. Once a chip has been programmed, the recorded information cannot be changed. It is a non-volatile memory.

- *EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory)* − EPROM chip can be programmed by erasing the information stored earlier in it. Information stored in EPROM exposing the chip for ultraviolet light. 

- *EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory)* − It is programmed and erased by special electrical waves in milliseconds. A single byte of data or the entire contents of the device can be erased.

## Difference between RAM and ROM

| DIFFIERENCE | RAM | ROM |
| ------------| ---------- | ---------|
|Data Retention | RAM is a volatile memory which could store the data as long as the power is supplied | ROM is a non-volatile memory which could retain the data even when the power is turned off |
| Working Type | Data stored in RAM can be retrieved and altered | Data stored in ROM can only we read |
| Use | Used to store the data that has to be currently processed by CPU temporary | It stores the instructions require during bootstrap of the computer|
| Speed | It is a high speed memory | It is much slower than RAM |
| CPU intreaction | The CPU can access the data stored on it | The CPU cannot access the data stored on it unless the data is stored in RAM |
|Size and capacity | Small size with less capacity | Large  size with higher capacity |
| Used as/in | CPU age, primary memory | Firmware, micro-controller |
| Accessibility | The data store is easily accessible | The data storage not as easily accessible as in RAM |
|Cost | Costlier | Cheaper than RAM |
| stroage | RAM chip can store only a few megabytes (MB) of data | ROM chip can store multiple gigabytes (GB) of data |


## Secondary Memory 

It is an external memory of the computer. It is also known as Auxiliary memory or permanent memory. It is used to store different programs and the information permanently. We call it a non-volatile memory that means the data is stored permanently even if power is switched off.

The secondary storage devices are as follows −

- Floppy Disks
- Magnetic (Hard) Disk 
- Magnetic Tapes 
- Pen Drive
- Winchester Disk
- Optical Disk (CD, DVD)

## Storage Devices

1. *Magnetic Storage devices* - The Magnetic Storage devices store information that can be read, erased and rewritten a number of times. Example

- Floppy Disks
- Hard Disks
- Magnetic Tapes etc.

2. *Optical Storage devices* - The optical storage devices that use laser beams to read and write stored data. Example
- CD(Compact Disk)
- DVD(Digital Versatile Disk)
