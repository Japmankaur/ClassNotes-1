# Memory and storage devices of Computer System

## Computer System

A Computer is an electronic device that stores, manipulates and retrieves the data. We can also refer computer computes the information supplied to it and generates data.

A System is a group of several objects with a process. For Example: Educational System involves teacher, students (objects). Teacher teaches subject to students i.e. teaching (process).

Similarly a computer system can have objects and process. The following are the objects of computer System 
1. User ( A person who uses the computer)
2. Hardware
3. Software

# Hardware

Hardware of a computer system can be referred as anything which we can touch and feel. Example Keyboard and Mouse.

The hardware of a computer system can be classified as
1. Input Devices(I/P)
2. Processing Devices (CPU)
3. Output Devices(O/P)

## Arithmetic and logical unit (ALU)

It performs the Arithmetic and Logical Operations such as 
1. +,-,*,/ (Arithmetic Operators)
2. &&, || ( Logical Operators)

## Control unit (CU)

Every Operation such as storing , computing and retrieving the data should be governed by the control unit. OUTPUT ALU, CU, MONITOR MEMORY UNIT (MU), KEYBOARD

## MEMORY UNIT 

Memory is a storage part in a computer system. It is used to store the data, information and programs at the time of processing on the computer. It stores data either temporarily or permanent. The main use of memory is saving and
retrieving data.

The Memory unit is used for storing the data. The Memory unit is classified
into two types. They are
1) Primary Memory
2) Secondary Memory
