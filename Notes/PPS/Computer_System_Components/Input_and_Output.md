# Input Devices
Input devices are the devices that are used to send signals to the computer for
performing tasks. The receiver at the end is the CPU (Central Processing Unit),
which works to send signals to the output devices. Some of the classifications
of Input devices are:
• **Keyboard Devices**
• **Pointing Devices**
• **Composite Devices**
• **Game Controller**
• **Visual Devices**
• Audio Input Devices
# Keyboard
Keyboard is the most common and very popular input device which helps to input 
data to the computer. The layout of the keyboard is like that of traditional typewriter, although there are some additional keys provided for performing 
additional functions.
Keyboards are of two sizes 84 keys or 101/102 keys, but now keyboards with 104 
keys or 108 keys are also available for Windows and Internet.
**Mouse**
Mouse is the most popular pointing device. It is a very famous cursor-control 
device having a small palm size box with a round ball at its base, which sensthe movement of the mouse and sends corresponding signals to the CPU when 
the mouse buttons are pressed.
Generally, it has two buttons called the left and the right button and a wheel is 
present between the buttons. A mouse can be used to control the position of the 
cursor on the screen, but it cannot be used to enter text into the computer.
# Joystick
Joystick is also a pointing device, which is used to move the cursor position on a 
monitor screen. It is a stick having a spherical ball at its both lower and upper 
ends. The lower spherical ball moves in a socket. The joystick can be moved in 
all four directions.
The function of the joystick is similar to that of a mouse. It is mainly used in 
Computer Aided Designing (CAD) and playing computer games.
# Light Pen
Light pen is a pointing device similar to a pen. It is used to select a displayed 
menu item or draw pictures on the monitor screen. It consists of a photocell and 
an optical system placed in a small tube.
When the tip of a light pen is moved over the monitor screen and the pen button 
is pressed, its photocell sensing element detects the screen location and sends the 
corresponding signal to the CPU.
# Track Ball
Track ball is an input device that is mostly used in notebook or laptop computer, 
instead of a mouse. This is a ball which is half inserted and by moving fingers on 
the ball, the pointer can be moved.
Since the whole device is not moved, a track ball requires less space than a mouse. 
A track ball comes in various shapes like a ball, a button, or a square.
Scanner
Scanner is an input device, which works more like a photocopy machine. It is 
used when some information is available on paper and it is to be transferred to 
the hard disk of the computer for further manipulation.Scanner captures images from the source which are then converted into a digital 
form that can be stored on the disk. These images can be edited before they are 
printed.
# Digitizer
Digitizer is an input device which converts analog information into digital form. 
Digitizer can convert a signal from the television or camera into a series of 
numbers that could be stored in a computer. They can be used by the computer to 
create a picture of whatever the camera had been pointed at.
Digitizer is also known as Tablet or Graphics Tablet as it converts graphics and 
pictorial data into binary inputs. A graphic tablet as digitizer is used for fine works 
of drawing and image manipulation applications.
# Microphone
Microphone is an input device to input sound that is then stored in a digital form.
The microphone is used for various applications such as adding sound to a 
multimedia presentation or for mixing music.
# Magnetic Ink Card Reader (MICR)
MICR input device is generally used in banks as there are large number of 
cheques to be processed every day. The bank's code number and cheque number 
are printed on the cheques with a special type of ink that contains particles of 
magnetic material that are machine readable.
This reading process is called Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR). The 
main advantages of MICR is that it is fast and less error prone.
Optical Character Reader (OCR)
OCR is an input device used to read a printed text.
OCR scans the text optically, character by character, converts them into a 
machine readable code, and stores the text on the system memory.
# Bar Code Readers
Bar Code Reader is a device used for reading bar coded data (data in the form of 
light and dark lines). Bar coded data is generally used in labelling goods, 
numbering the books, etc. It may be a handheld scanner or may be embedded in 
a stationary scanner.
Bar Code Reader scans a bar code image, converts it into an alphanumeric value, 
which is then fed to the computer that the bar code reader is connected to.
# Optical Mark Reader (OMR)
OMR is a special type of optical scanner used to recognize the type of mark made 
by pen or pencil. It is used where one out of a few alternatives is to be selected 
and marked.
Output Devices are the devices that show us the result after giving the
input to a computer system. Output can be of many different forms like
image, graphic audio, video, etc. Some of the output devices are described
below.
•** Monitors**: The computer monitors are responsible for displaying the 
results received after processing and completing all the operations in the 
central processing unit. The technology in designing the display devices 
has evolved from monochrome monitors to colored monitors to the latest 
LED/LCDs.
• **Printers**: Printers are another output device, similar to monitors, but the 
difference is that the output data received are produced into hard copies. 
The performance standards of the printer device are qualified based on the 
processing speed, the printing resolution, the processing memory capacity, 
printing color feature, etc.
• **Speaker**: Speakers are used for obtaining the audio formatted output data, 
which comes with various extensions like.MP3, MPEG, .WMA, etc. This 
device aids in sending out audible alerts to the user, accessing the data with 
music or audio, communication systems, etc.
• **Projector**: A projector is a device that permits the users to project their 
output in a large area or a large screen. Users can use it to display the results 
of a computer and other devices onto a screen. It heightens texts, images, 
and films employing light and lenses. As a result, it becomes an ideal 
output device for providing presentations or teaching many audiences.
