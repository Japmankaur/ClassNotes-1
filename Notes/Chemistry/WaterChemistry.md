## WATER CHEMISTRY
### Sources of water:
**Water is a critical resource for human survival and livelihood. It is essential for drinking, agriculture, industry, and ecosystem health. There are three sources of water on Earth:**

**1. Rainwater**: Rainwater is one of the most abundant sources of water, supplying the majority of the world's freshwater. While it is not always consistent, rainwater can be harvested and stored for future use, providing a reliable source of water in many regions.

**2. Surface Water:** Surface water includes rivers, lakes, ponds, and other bodies of water on the surface of the Earth. This type of water is essential for aquatic ecosystems. It can not be directly used for domestic purpose.

**3. Groundwater:** Groundwater is the water that exists beneath the Earth's surface, trapped in porous soil or rock layers. This type of water is essential for maintaining healthy ecosystems and is also a vital source of water for human use. It can be accessed using wells, pumps, or other technologies and is often used for irrigation and drinking water purposes.

### Impurities in Water:
**Some of the most common impurities found in water are:**

**Solids:** These can include dirt, sand, and other particles that can be suspended in the water or settle at the bottom. They can also include sediment or silt, which is a combination of solids and organic matter.

**Dissolved gases:** Carbon dioxide is a common dissolved gas in water, but other gases such as oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen can also be present.

**Organic compounds:** These can include natural organic compounds such as organic matter from plants and animals, fugai and algi, as well as synthetic organic compounds such as pesticides and detergents.

**Pathogens:** These include bacteria, viruses, and parasites that can cause illness in humans and animals.

**Chemical pollutants:** These can include synthetic chemicals and industrial solvents that have been discharged into water sources.

### Hardness of Water:
**Property of water due to which it doesn't make lather (foam) with soap. It is due to the presence of salts of Calcium and magnesium. Hardness of water is of two types:**

| Temporary hardness | Permanent Hardness |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| **1.** Temporary hardness is also known as Carbonate Hardness. | **1.** Permanent hardness is also known as non-carbonate hardness.  |
| **2.** It is due to the salts of carbonantes.  CaCO₃, MgCO₃, Ca(HCO₃)₂, Mg(HCO₃)₂ | **2.** It is due to the salts of chlorine, sulphate and nitrates. CaCl₂, MgCl₂, CaSO₄, MgSO₄, Ca(NO₃)₂, Mg(NO₃)₂ |
| **3.** It can easily be removed by boiling.| **3.** It can be removed by special methods. |
| Ca(HCO₃)₂(aq) → CaCO₃(s) + H₂O(l) + CO₂(g) |Lime soda process, Zeolite Process, Ion exchange process |


### QUESTION:
**Why hard water doesn't make lather with soap?**
### ANSWER
**CaSO₄(aq) + 2C₁₇H₃₅COONa(aq) → Ca(C₁₇H₃₅COO)₂(s) + Na₂SO₄(aq)**

**Calcium sulfate + Sodium Stearate → Calcium stearate + Sodium sulfate**

*Hard water is water that contains salts of calcium and magnesium, which react with  Sodium Sterate (soap molecules) and form white scum, a sticky and greasy residue on surfaces.*


# Unit 1 water and its treatment

## Topic:-Difference between hard water and soft water

|Hardwater|Softwater|
|---|---|
|1.Water which does not form lather with soap is called Hard water|1.Water which forms lather easily with soap is called soft water|
|2.Hardwater has dissolved salts of calcium and magnesium|2.Softwater does not have dissolved salts of ca and mg|
|3.Because of presence of impurities,boiling temperature,of water is increased,because of which a lot of time go water for heating |3.Less time and fuel is consumed for heating softwater|
|4.Because of presence of impurities lot of soap is consumed by hardwater|4.Softwater consumes less soap for washing and bathing purposes |

## Methods to remove permanent hardness
There are three methods to remove permanent hardness:-

**Lime-Soda**
The method involves the treatment of water with lime[Ca(OH)2] and soda [Na2(CO)3] which reasults in the formation of insoluble precipitates of Calcium and Magnesium which can be removed by filtration.

**(A)Cold Lime-Soda Process**
In this method, water to be softened is treated with calculated quantities of lime and soda at room temperature. Small amounts of a coagulant such as alum, aluminium sulphate, sodium aluminate etc., are also added.
The coagulant helps the finely divided precipitate formed in the process to flocculate. Sodium aluminate also helps in the removal of silica and oil present in water.


**(B)Hot Lime-Soda Process**
In this process, water is treated with the softening chemicals at a temperature of 94°-100°C. Since the process is carried out at a temperature close to the boiling point of the solution, the reaction proceeds faster and the softening capacity of the process increases several times.
At this temperature, the viscosity of water is much less than that at room temperature. Hence, rate of aggregation of particles increases and there is hardly any need of adding any coagulant. Moreover, the dissolved gases also escape to some extent at the temperature of the process.

**(C)Zeolite or Permutit process:-** This is a very effective method.
Chemical formula of zeolite is:-Na₂O·Al₂O₃·xSiO₂·yH₂O;where x=2-10,y=2-6
Hydrated sodium alumino silicate or sodium zeolite.
Permanent hardness of water can be removed by permutit process. Permutite is an artifical zeolite used for softening of water. Through ion-exchange process, here cation-anion exchange chamber is used to obtain pure water. In calgon's process sodium hexa meta phosphate is used to soften the water.

**Ion exchange or de-ionization process:-** Ion-exchange or Deionization or Demineralization Process - Recently ion-exchange resins have been used to remove all minerals from water. It is a process by which ions held on a porous, essentially insoluble solid are exchanged for ions in solution that is brought in contact with it.
Ion-exchange Resin – An ion-exchange resin is a crosslinked organic polymer network having some ionisable group. It may be of two types depending upon the nature of the ionizable group.

**(D)Cation Exchange Resin or Cation Exchanger:-** Such resins have - SO₃H, -- COOH or -OH (phenolic) group as the ionizable group. Since these resins exchange the cationic portion of minerals by their hydrogen atom, they are known as cation exchangers.

**(E) Anion Exchange Resin or Anion Exchanger :–** These resins have -NH₂, -NHCH₃, -N(CH₃)₂ or -OH group. They exchange the anionic portion of the minerals and they are known as anion exchanger.
Uses of Ion-exchange Resin – Water treatment by ion-exchange resin includes softening deionization and de-alkalization of water. Therefore, hard water can be converted into soft water by making use of ion-exchange resins.
## Degree of Hardness of Water

1. Degree of hardness is defined as the number of parts of calcium carbonate or equivalent to various calcium and magnesium salts present in a million parts of water by mass.
The more calcium and magnesium the water contains, the harder the water. 
2. Water hardness is usually expressed in milligrams per litre (mg/L) or in ppm (parts per million).
3. Degree of Hardness = (The weight of hardness causing salts × 100 (Molecular weight of CaCO3)) / Molecular weight of hardness causing salts.

## Why Calcium Carbonate is considered as a standard for calculating hardness ?

1. Its molecular weight (100) and equivalent weight (50) is a whole number, so the calculations in water analysis can be simplified. 
2. It is the most insoluble salt that can be precipitated in water treatment.

## Numericals on Degree of Hardness of Water 

### Problem-1:
A sample of water is found to contains following dissolving salts in milligrams per litre 
Mg(HCO3)2 = 73, CaCl2 = 111, Ca(HCO3)2 = 81, MgSO4 = 40 and MgCl2 = 95. Calculate temporary and 
permanent hardness and total hardness.

### Solution: 

| Name of the hardness causing salts | Amount of the hardness causing salts(mg/Lit) | Molecular weight of hardness causing salts | Amounts equivalent to CaCO3 (mg/Lit) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mg(HCO3)_2 | 73 | 146 | 73×100/146=50 |
| CaCl_2 | 111 | 111 | 111×100/111 = 100 |
| Ca(HCO3)_2 | 81 | 162 | 81×100/162 = 50 |
| MgSO_4 | 40 | 120 | 40×100/120 = 33.3 |
| MgCl_2 | 95 | 95 | 95×100/95 = 100 |

#### Temporary hardness 
                   = Mg(HCO3)2 + Ca(HCO3)_2
                   = 50 + 50 = 100mgs/Lit.
#### Permanent hardness 
                   = CaCl_2 + MgSO_4 + MgCl_2
                   = 100 + 33.3 + 100 = 233.3 mgs/Lit.
#### Total hardness 
               = Temporary hardness + Permanent hardness
               = 100 + 233.3 = 333.3 mgs/Lit.


### Problem-2:
A sample of water is found to contains following dissolving salts in milligrams per litre 
Mg(HCO3)2 = 16.8, MgCl2 = 12.0, MgSO4 = 29.6 and NaCl = 5.0. Calculate temporary and permanent hardness of water.

### Solution:

| Name of the hardness causing salts | Amount of the hardness causing salts(mg/Lit) | Molecular weight of hardness causing salts | Amounts equivalent to CaCO3 (mg/Lit) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mg(HCO3)_2 | 16.8 | 146 | 16.8×100/146 = 11.50 |
| MgCl_2 | 12.0 | 95 | 12.0×100/95 = 12.63 |
| MgSO_4 | 29.6 | 120 | 29.6×100/120 = 24.66 |
| NaCl | 5.0 | NaCl does not contribute any hardness to water hence it is ignored. |

#### Temporary hardness 
                   = Mg(HCO3)2 
                   = 11.50 mgs/Lit.
#### Permanent hardness = MgCl2 + MgSO4 
                    = 12.63 + 24.66
                    = 37.29 mgs/Lit.
