## Experiment 1
### Aim:
**Introduction to glass apparatus in chemistry labouratry. Its handling, using, cleaning and precautions to  be taken.**
### Apparatus:
**Beaker, Pipette, Titration flask, Funnel, Burette, Burette Stand, Cylinder**

### Beaker:
*Beakers are cylindrical in shape with a flat bottom. They are generally made of glass and are graduated with markings to measure liquids accurately. Most also have a small spout (or "beak") to aid pouring.*
*Beakers come in different sizes, with the most common being 50 ml, 100 ml, 250 ml, 500 ml etc.*

**Use**

*Beakers are primarily used to hold and mix solutions/ liquids.*

**Handling / Precautions:**
* Before use, always check for cracks or chips in the glass. Discard any damaged glassware.
* When pouring liquid into a beaker, do so slowly to avoid splashing.
* Always handle beakers by their body, not by the neck.
* When filling or transferring liquids, use a spout or funnel to avoid spilling.
* Do not expose beakers to heat or open flames directly as this can cause the glass to crack or shatter.

### Conical Flask:
*Conical flask is also known as Titration Flask. It is a flask with wide, flat bottom and a cylindrical neck. They are available in various sizes including; 25 ml, 50 ml, 100 ml, 125 ml, 150 ml etc.*

**Use**

*It is used for titration and storage.*

**Handling / Precautions:**
* Before use, always check for cracks or chips in the glass.
* Avoid shaking, hitting or dropping the Conical flask.
* While doing titration, hold it by the neck.


### Funnel:
*A funnel is a tube or pipe that is wide at the top and narrow at the bottom.*

**Use** 

*Funnel is used for guiding liquid into a small opening.*

**Handling / Precautions:**
* Choose the right size of funnel.
* Make sure there are no crack or chips on the glass.
* Hold Funnel with steady hands to avoid spilling.
* After transferring the liquid, carefully take out the funnel from the container.

### Burette:
 *Burette typically consists of a glass tube with a stopclock at one end and a graduation scale marked on the side.*

 **Use:**
 
*Burette is used in analytical chemistry for the precise dispensing of a solution/liquid, especially of one of the reagents in a titration.*

**Handling / Precautions:**
* Ensure the burette is clean and free from any residue or water droplets.
* Handle the stopcock carefully to prevent leaks and breakage.
* Clean the burette thoroughly after use.
* Control the flow of liquid smoothly and carefully during titrations.
* Rinse the burette with the solution to be used to ensure accurate measurements.


### Burette stand:
*It consists of a stand along with a clamp to hold Burette. The clamp can be adjusted to securely hold different sizes of burettes in place.*

**Use**

*It is used to hold and stabilize burettes during titration or other laboratory processes.*

**Handling / Precautions:**
* Ensure the burette stand is placed on a stable, level surface.
* Tighten the burette clamp securely to hold the burette firmly in place.
* Adjust the height of the burette clamp to ensure proper alignment with the titration flask.

### Pipette:

*It is a slender, hollow tube with a bulb in its body.*

**Use**

*Pipette is used to measure and transfer small quantities of solution/liquid.*
*To use pipette, put the tip of pipette in the desired liquid/solution to transfer. Place your mouth on the other open end of pipette and suck air in to create vaccume. The amount of liquid that will be drawn into the pipette will depend on the size of the pipette you are using and the amount of force you use to create the vacuum.*
*When you have the desired amount of liquid in the pipette, remove it from the liquid and hold it over the receiving container.*
 
**Handling / Precautions:**
* To prevent damage hold pipette at a distance from the bottom of the container before drawing liquid.
* Hold the pipette at a 10 to 45 degree angle when dispensing.
* After transferring the liquid using the pipette, it's not advisable to shake it to take out the last drops of liquid left in it.
### Cylinder:
*Cylinder or  graduated cylinder. It consists of a cylindrical tube with a narrow, vertical scale marked on the outside. It has a plastic or glass base (foot) and a "spout" for easy pouring.*

**Use**

*It is used to measure the volume of a liquid.*

**Handling / Precautions:**
* Place the graduated cylinder on a flat surface.
* Make sure the scale of the cylinder is clear and not damaged.
* Avoid dropping or hitting the cylinder


### Cleaning:
* Wash the apparatus with distilled water.
* Always rinse the glass apparatus with runniing water before use.
* Dont use hot water to rinse as it can cause the glass to crack.
* Avoid using steel wool or sharp objects to clean the apparatus.
* Make sure to dry the apparatus before and after rinsing. 

## Experiment 2
### Aim:

**To determine the strength of a hard water sample in mg/L by using 0.01M EDTA solution/ complex metro titration.**

### Apparatus:

**Burette, Burette stand, pipette, titraton flask, funnel, dropper and white tile.**

### Chemical required:

**0.01M EDTA, sample water, Ammonia Buffer and Indicator- Eriochrome Black T (EBT)**

### End point:

*Change in color from wine red to blue.*

### Chemical equation:

**M⁺² + EBT → [M-EBT]**

Proceeds in the presence of Ammonia Buffer. Here Ammonia Buffer is used to maintain the pH. 

**[M-EBT] → [M-EDTA] + EBT**

Proceeds in presence of EDTA having concentration M/100.

### Theory:

EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, meaning it can bind to a metal ion with six donor atoms. It's cheap in cost and the solution can be quite stable over time, Hence is used in the titration.

EBT serves as a visual indicator. It initially forms a colored complex with the metal ion (M⁺²). As EDTA is added, it chelates the metal ion, displacing EBT. The release of EBT results in a color change, indicating the endpoint of the titration.

### Procedure:

1. Rinse the apparatus with running water.
2. Fill the burette with 0.01M EDTA solution and tighten the burette clamp securely to hold the burette firmly in place.
3. Pipette out 25mL of water sample and transfer it to a titration/conical flask.
4. Put two drops of Ammonia Buffer in the titration flask containing the water sample.
5. Put a drop of EBT in the solution, the color of solution will turn wine red.
6. Place the titration flask on the burette stand.

 **Start Titration:**
   
1. Note the initial reading on the Burette.   
2. Hold the stopclock with one hand and titration flask with other.
3. Shake the titration flask gently as the drop of EDTA solution pour in the titration flask.
4. Close the stopclock when the color of solution in titration flask turn from wine red to blue.
5. Note down the final reading from the burette.
6. Repeat the steps 3-4 times.
 
   ### Observations: 
   
   | S. No. | Intial Burette Reading | Final Burette Reading | Volume Of EDTA Used |
   | ------ | ---------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
   | 1. | 21.7 | 28.2 | 6.5 |
   | 2. | 28.2 | 34.5 | 6.3 |
   | 3. | 34.5 | 6.3 | 6.6 |

 ### Calculations:

 Volume of EDTA solution (V₂) = (6.5+6.3+6.6)/3
 
  = 6.46 mL
 
 M₁V₁ = M₂V₂
 
M₁ = Molar weight of sample water

V₁ = Volume of sample water

M₂ = Molar weight of EDTA

M₁ * 25ml = 0.001M * V₂
  
  M₁ = (0.01 * 6.46)/ 25
  
  = 0.002584
  
  = 0.002584 * 100 = 0.2584 

  **Strength of sample water:**

  = 0.2584 * 1000
  
  = 258.4 g/L

  ### Precautions:
  1. Handle the stopcock carefully to prevent leaks.
  2. Tighten the burette clamp securely to hold the burette firmly in place.
  3. Adjust the height of the burette clamp to ensure proper alignment with the titration flask.
  4. After transferring the solution using the pipette, do not shake out the last drops of solution left in it.
  5. Shake the titration flask gently, make sure the EDTA solution isnt on the inner walls of it.
   
## Experiment: 3

### Aim:

**To determine the chloride content in the given water sample (in mg/L) by using N/50 AgNO₃ (Arentometric Titration) (Precipitate Titration)**

### Apparatus: 

**Burette, Burette stand, dropper, funnel, beaker, pipette, titration flask and white tile**
 
### Chemicle required:

**Sample water, N/50 AgNO₃ and Indicator- Potassium Chromate (K₂Cr₃)**

### End Point: 

**Yellow to Brick red Precipitates**

### Chemical equation:

 **MCl₂ + 2AgNO₃ → 2AgCl + M(NO₃)₂**
 
*M in this reaction is Metal ion ie: Calcium and magnesium.*

 **2AgNO₃ + K₂CrO₄ → AgCrO₄ + 2KNO₃** 

 *In this reaction the brick red ppts are made by AgCrO₄*

 ### Theory:

 Chloride in the form of Chloride ion is one of the major inorganic anion in water and waste water Chloride content in water means presence of CaCl₂, MgCl₂, NaCl etc.
 
 Chloride content is estimated by using Arentometric Titration. Water containing Chlorides are titrated with silver nitrate (AgNO₃) solution, chlorides are precipated as Silver Chloride (AgCrO₄).
 
 Potassium chromate (K₂CrO₄) is used as an indicator, which gives chromate ions as the concentration of chloride ions approaches entincation, silver ions concentration increases to a level at which brick red precipitate of Silver Chromate (AgCrO₄) is formed indicating the end point.

### Observation:

| S. No. | Initial Burette Reading | Final Burette Reading | Volume of AgNO₃ used |
| ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | 30.5| 32.2 | 1.7 |
| 2. | 32.2 | 33.8 | 1.7 |
| 3. | 33.9 | 35.6 | 1.7 |

### Calculation:

 Volume of AgNO₃ solution (V₂) = ( 1.7+1.7+1.7 )/3
                               = 1.7 mg/L
                               
 N₁V₁ = N₂V₂
 
N₁ = Normal weight of sample water

V₁ = Volume of sample water

N₂ = Normal weight of AgNO₃


N₁ * 25ml = N/50 * V₂

N₁ * 25ml = N/50 * 1.7

N₁ = 1.7 / ( 50*25 )

= 0.00136 g/L

Strength = 0.00136 * 35.5
= 0.04828 g/L
= 0.04828 * 1000 mg/L
= 48028 mg/L
